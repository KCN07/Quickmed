# Quickmed

This Demo project is mainly based on an Health related platform. IT will show us various services according to the facilities the hospital will give us. And one can easily view all the departments . I tried to update the project using React also used specially react-router for practice purpose. Here I practiced some new thing also like privateRoute, ContextApi, AuthProvider, Firebase etc.

## Run The Project
=> First you have to install NPM and React(if your computer doesn't have NPM and React installed already).

=> Then You have to go to the project directory, you can run in the terminal:

### `npm start`

=> Then In browser The project will automatically display.
